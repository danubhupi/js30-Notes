Here suppose  

Task 15:-

here is learned about local storage which doesnt change when the page is refreshed,so we can 
save some info in the local storage and use it even after the page is reloaded

also learned abput event delegation, it means that an event listener is added to the 
oarent rather than the child ,what this helps s with is that we do not need to add individual 
event listeners to children element, 

why dont we want to add events to individual childs?
We dont want to do that in some cases because in thse cases we might add more children elemnts
later and then the new children wont have the event listeners and the cpde will break
for them.

made shadows that changed according to the position of the mouse ,easy tings it only required
a bit of math
